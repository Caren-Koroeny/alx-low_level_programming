# C - File I/O.

Today I learned about the **three standard file descriptors** and their `POSIX` names as well as the difference between **function** and **system calls**. I practised using the I/O system calls `open`, `close`, `read`, and `write` and the flags `O_RDONLY` ,` WR_ONLY, and `O_RDWR` to create, open, close, read, write, set permissions of files in C.

## Header File file_folder.

 - main.h: Header file containing prototypes for all functions written in the project.
